If a vampire bites you, you become a vampire spawn and your master is the vampire that turned you. If the vampire spawn kills its master, or your master feeds you their blood, then you turn into a vampire.   
 
Vampire spawns crave blood, can't be in the sun, etc, but they don’t get any of the powers of the vampires, (cant turn into animals, cant fly, etc). Vampire spawn are also compelled to do whatever their master says. 

Vampire spawn and their masters are undead.
