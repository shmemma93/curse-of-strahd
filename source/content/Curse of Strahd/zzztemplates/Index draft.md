# Welcome to the Player Notes for Declan's Curse of Strahd Campaign

In the menu on the left (hopefully) you will see a wiki containing all of the details from the previous sessions. 

On each page you will notice a couple of things:
* There are links out to other pages. 
* You will see 'backlinks', these are pages which reference the page you are currently on. 
* There is a 'Graph view' which indicates how many other pages reference this page. A bigger graph means the contents on the page is probably more important to the story. 

This currently includes all notes from:
* [[Session 1]]
* [[Session 2]]
