Who is this for: [[Madame Eva]]
# Description of the Quest
 From the second card of [[Madame Eva]]'s tarokka reading. 

*"This card tells of a powerful force for good and protection, a holy symbol of great hope."*

*"What you seek lies in a pile of treasure beyond a set of amber doors."*
# General Notes
* Maybe this is related to the Icon of Ravenloft which [[Matt]] found in [[Session 9]]?
