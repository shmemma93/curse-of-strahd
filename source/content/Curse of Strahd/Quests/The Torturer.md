Who is this for: [[Madame Eva]]
# Description of the Quest
 From the first card of [[Madame Eva]]'s tarokka reading. 

*"This card tells of history. Knowledge of the ancient will help you better understand your enemy."*

*"There is a town where all is not well. There you will find a house of corruption, and within, a dark room full of still ghosts."*
# General Notes
Is this straight up referring to [[Tome of Strahd von Zarovich]] which we got from [[Victor Vallakovich]]'s room? [[Vallaki]] is a town where all is not well. Maybe the house of corruption is referring to [[Victor Vallakovich]] since surely his father would think he is corrupt and he was using necromancy? The room of still ghosts is interesting and [[Victor Vallakovich]]'s room would be a stretch for this.... maybe [[Izek Strazni]]'s weird room of dolls are still ghosts? Maybe we need to check after a while if we recognise other people?
