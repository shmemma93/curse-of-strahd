Who is this for: [[Madame Eva]]
# Description of the Quest
 From the third card of [[Madame Eva]]'s tarokka reading. 

*"This is a card of power and strength. It tells of a weapon of vengeance: a sword of sunlight."*

*"I see a dead village, drowned by a river, ruled by one who has brought great evil into the world."*
# General Notes
* Maybe in [[Barez]]? No real clue, just that there is a river there and is definitely a dead town and [[Baba Lysaga]] seems like she bought great evil to the world?
