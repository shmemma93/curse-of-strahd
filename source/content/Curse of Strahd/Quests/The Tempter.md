Who is this for: [[Madame Eva]]
# Description of the Quest
 From the fifth card of [[Madame Eva]]'s tarokka reading. 

*"Your enemy is a creature of darkness, whose powers are beyond mortality. This card will lead you to him!"*

*"I see a secret place - a vault of temptation hidden behind a woman of great beauty. The evil waits atop his tower of treasure."*
# General Notes
* We assume that the 'secret place' is [[Strahd's Secret Temple]]? Maybe we should check out the top of [[Ravenloft]] to be sure? There is a tower in [[Ravenloft]] which we came across in [[Session 10]]
