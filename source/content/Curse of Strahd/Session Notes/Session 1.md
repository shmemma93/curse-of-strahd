Who was here this session: [[Emereth]], [[Dogorasu]], [[Alder]], [[Galina]], [[Janet]], and [[Matt]]

The party all start in the [[Village of Barovia]]. We pass by [[Mad Marys House]] and find out later from [[Ismark Indirovich]] that the crying woman is called [[Mad Mary]]. 

**Quest triggered: [[Help Mad Mary]]**

The party enters [[Blood of the Vine Tavern]] and we find out from three Vistanis that they are the only people who can travel through the fog and they let us know that we should see [[Madame Eva]] who will read our fortunes. 

**Quest triggered: [[Find Madame Eva]]**

Here we also meet [[Ismark Indirovich]]. He asks us to transport his sister ([[Ireena Indirovich]]) to [[Vallaki]]. 

**Quest triggered: [[Escort Ireena to Vallaki]]**

After accepting [[Ismark Indirovich]]'s quest, we head to the [[Burgomaster of Barovia's Mansion]]. When we enter we see a coffin, which we find out contains [[Ismark Indirovich]] and [[Ireena Indirovich]]'s father ([[Kolyan Indirovich]]). Although she will not go to [[Vallaki]] without her father being buried

**Quest triggered: [[Bury Ismark's Father]]**

The party decides to head to [[Church and Cemetery]], where upon entry we meet [[Father Donovich]] and we can also hear screams coming from within a trapdoor. The screams are from what sounds like a man and that he is hungry "FATHER! I AM HUNGRY". [[Father Donovich]] lets us know that [[Strahd]] took his son [[Guy in Cellar (Father Donovich's Son)]], although he doesnt tell us what happened to his son. 

**Quest triggered: [[What's in the Cellar?]]**

From here we head out to the Cemetery and spend many hours digging a hole for [[Kolyan Indirovich]], we have a nice ceremony and head back to [[Burgomaster of Barovia's Mansion]].

On the way back we meet an old lady ([[Main Hag]]) who is taking a child ([[Lucien]]) from his parents as payment for wares. [[Lucien]] is worth 1200 gold. [[Emereth]] punches the lady, the rest of the party joins in to defeat [[Main Hag]]. Before she disappears she says that [[Strahd]] has undead enemies in the [[Order of the Silver Dragon]] and that [[Strahd]]'s biggest secret is a [[Strahd's Secret Temple]] accessible via the [[Silenca Pass]]. 

**Quest triggered: [[Stop the Hag Trafficking Kids]]**

After returning [[Lucien]] to his parents, we start heading down a path into [[Barovia Valley]]. We come to a cross roads where there is a sign with [[Village of Barovia]] to the east, [[Tser Pool]] to the West where there is also a [[Vistani Encampment]] and [[Ravenloft]]/[[Vallaki]] to the southwest. The group heads towards [[Vallaki]].

[[Galina]] sees a lifeless grey corpse hanging on the gallows, which rapidly decays upon direct sight. 

There is a letter on the road addressed to [[Matt]]. The letter is from his father ([[Matt's Dad]]) who is almost departed, but it seems suspicious. The party continues on and we end up at the [[Vistani Encampment]]. 

Once we get there the [[Tser Pool]] is nearby, [[Janet]] jumps in to get clean and [[Alder]] joins her. When we arrive and older vistani approaches [[Matt]] and says "it was fated you would visit our humble camp" and directs us to a tent. A younger woman asks us to sit and listen to a story. It describes a man on horseback and a mighty wizard (presumably [[Wizard]]) came to this land over a year ago, could rally people against [[Strahd]]. The army fled in terror of [[Strahd]], [[Wizard]] and [[Strahd]] fought, [[Wizard]] lost and is now missing. 

We enter [[Madame Eva]]'s tent, [[Janet]] kisses the Tarokka deck and [[Madame Eva]] deals five cards:
* The Torturer
* The Bishop
* The Conjurer
* The Donjon
* The Tempter

**Quests triggered: [[The Torturer]], [[The Bishop]], [[The Conjurer]], [[The Donjon]], and [[The Tempter]]**

She states that we need to follow the path from start to end, it is the fate laid out before us. 

We keep heading to [[Vallaki]] and come across a large gate with statues on either side. There is a sign that says that [[Ravenloft]] is to the east. We keep walking toward [[Vallaki]] and come across an old windmill ([[Old Bonegrinder Mill]]), we walk towards it. 

**Quest triggered: [[Fuck Strahd]]**
