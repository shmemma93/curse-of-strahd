Who was here this session: [[Emereth]], [[Dogorasu]], [[Alder]], [[Galina]], [[Janet]], and [[Matt]]
# TLDR
The group rids [[Henrik Van der Voorts Shop]] of some vampire spawn and he lets us know that [[Vasili von Holtz]] was the one who wanted the bones. We head back to [[St Andral's Cathedral]] and return the bones to the crypt. We then head to [[Burgomaster of Vallaki's Mansion]] where we meet [[Burgomaster Vargus Vallakovich]] and [[Baroness Lydia Petrovna]]. [[Baroness Lydia Petrovna]] asks us to bing people to [[Vallaki]] from [[Barovia Town]] and/or [[Krezk]]. We return to [[The Blue Water Inn]] for the night, then in the morning we head to [[Blinsky's Toy Store]] where we meet [[Gadof Blinksy]] and [[Piccolo]]. We see that [[Gadof Blinksy]] has been making toys that look like [[Ireena Kolyana]] for [[Izek Strazni]]. 
# Detailed Notes
The group gets jumped by some vampire spawn while [[Henrik Van der Voort]] cowers behind a coffin. Once we defeat the spawn, [[Matt]] asks why [[Henrik Van der Voort]] took the bones, to which he replies that he was promised good business in return. [[Henrik Van der Voort]] also informs us that [[Vasili von Holtz]] comes and goes as he pleases, so he is unsure when [[Vasili von Holtz]] will be here next. 

As a group we head back to [[St Andral's Cathedral]] and let [[Father Lucian Petrovich]] know that we have the bones. [[Matt]] lets [[Father Lucian Petrovich]] know about the vampire spawn. [[Father Lucian Petrovich]] questions [[Burgomaster Vargus Vallakovich]]'s motives, as a result, he does not want to report [[Henrik Van der Voort]]'s actions. [[Father Lucian Petrovich]] shows us the crypt and we return the bones into their shallow coffin. In return for returning the bones we are offered sanctuary in the church. 

Now we head to [[Burgomaster of Vallaki's Mansion]], when we arrive the maid answers the door and when we say that we are here on business, she leads is into a foyer. [[Burgomaster Vargus Vallakovich]] heads in and asks us if we are here to help with prep for the Festival of the Blazing Sun. [[Matt]] asks [[Burgomaster Vargus Vallakovich]] to make a deal: we help him and he helps us leave [[Barovia]]. [[Burgomaster Vargus Vallakovich]] loves [[Barovia]] and does not understand why we would want to leave. [[Matt]] mentions that the Vistani are able to leave but [[Burgomaster Vargus Vallakovich]] confirms that the Vistani are working for [[Strahd von Zarovich]]. 

We end up doing to meet [[Baroness Lydia Petrovna]] where nine ladies are having high-tea talking about decorations for the Festival of the Blazing Sun. We help make giant wooden suns out of sticks and sewing clothes for kids. [[Galina]] makes one of the ladies scream and [[Burgomaster Vargus Vallakovich]] busts into the room with two mastiffs. [[Baroness Lydia Petrovna]] talks about the Wachter Brothers ([[Wachter Brother 1]] and [[Wachter Brother 2]]), she also says that [[Lady Fiona Wachter]] is a devilish no good heathen. 

[[Baroness Lydia Petrovna]] wants us to bring people from [[Barovia Town]] and/or [[Krezk]] to come to [[Vallaki]].

**Quest triggered: [[Bring People to Vallaki]]**

[[Baroness Lydia Petrovna]] thinks that people being happy will keep [[Strahd von Zarovich]] at bay. 

We head back to [[The Blue Water Inn]], when we get there [[Yevgeni Krushkin]], [[Szoldar Szoldarovich]], [[Wachter Brother 1]], and [[Wachter Brother 2]] are there too. 

We sleep for the night and in the morning we head to [[Blinsky's Toy Store]]. When we enter we see that there are heaps of dolls and bears present. In one corner there are approximately 100 dolls and they look like [[Ireena Kolyana]]. [[Galina]] grabs the one which looks most like [[Ireena Kolyana]] and asks [[Gadof Blinksy]] why he has this doll. [[Gadof Blinksy]] says that he is making the doll for [[Izek Strazni]], as he will burn down [[Blinsky's Toy Store]] unless [[Gadof Blinksy]] makes a new doll each month. [[Galina]] threatens to kill [[Piccolo]] unless [[Gadof Blinksy]] makes a another doll. 

[[Gadof Blinksy]] tells us that the was given [[Piccolo]] from [[Rictavio]]. [[Fritz von Weerg]] made a clockwork man, which is in [[Ravenloft]]. If we get the clockwork man, we can have [[Piccolo]]. 

**Quest triggered: [[Recover the Clockwork Man from Ravenloft]]**
