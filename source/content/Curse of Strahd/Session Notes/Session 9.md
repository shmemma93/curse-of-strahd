Who was here this session: [[Emereth]], [[Dogorasu]], [[Alder]], [[Galina]], [[Janet]], and [[Matt]]
# TLDR
We head back to [[The Blue Water Inn]] and see that [[Lady Fiona Wachter]] is now the 'Democratic Figurehead' of [[Vallaki]]. We leave town and head towards [[Ravenloft]]. When we arrive we see an illusion of [[Strahd von Zarovich]] in the dining hall. We start to discover [[Ravenloft]] and meet and later kill [[Rahadin]]. We meet the dead body of [[Gustav Herrenghast]] and [[Matt]] grabs the Icon of Ravenloft. 

# Detailed Notes
We head back to [[The Blue Water Inn]] to rest and we have a brief chat to [[Irwin Martikov]]. When we wake up in the morning we hear heavy footsteps outside, where we see lines if town guards marching through the streets. The Crier is announcing the death of [[Burgomaster Vargus Vallakovich]] and [[Baroness Lydia Petrovna]] and that [[Lady Fiona Wachter]] is now the 'Democratic Figurehead'. 

We leave town, pass [[Old Bonegrinder Mill]] and reach a crossroads. There is a black carriage pointed in the easterly direction with two black horses, the door to the carriage opens. The horses don't react to be patted. We all get in the carriage, the doors swing shut and the carriage moves down the road. 

We start walking to the main door (which is the open door). There is a foyer which is about 20ft long and there is a second set of doors, which opens when approached. 

Inside the room there is a statue of a dragon in each corner. [[Matt]] takes a look at a dragon statue. He notices that the dragons appear to be mid-attack, likely to impose some sort of power over the people in the castle. He can also tell that they are closer to the size of a dragon wormling (baby dragon). The dragons are high up in the room, they cannot be reached. 

We walk through the next set of doors, there are cobwebs and iron sconces. There are gargoyles high up on the walls, there are bronze doors ahead and there is a staircase leading to darkness to the left and corridors to the right and organ music is coming from the right.  

We head to the right, we hear a voice behind us belonging to [[Rahadin]] who says ‘my master is expecting you’. [[Matt]] says that we are here to meet his master, he leads us through the double doors.

We enter the dining hall, there are three chandeliers, places set for each of us and there is a goblet with an amber liquid for each person. There is an organ at the end of the room, where a caped figure ([[Strahd von Zarovich]]) is playing the organ, he stops and turns towards us and says ‘Hello friends’. Janet starts eating the food and drinking the drink. Everyone else sits down, doesn't have a chair, so [[Strahd von Zarovich]] conjures one, which Mushy wont even sit on. \

[[Matt]] assesses the drink and it seems fine. [[Emereth]] and [[Janet]] have drunk theirs. We ask about the statues and [[Strahd von Zarovich]] confirms that the statues are based off wrymlings. Around the organ are statues of people wrapped around each other. 

We find out that [[Strahd von Zarovich]] is an illusion as all the lights go out, all of the doors are closed, and the portcullis is raised. 

[[Janet]] hands [[Alder]] the ham bone, which [[Alder]] lights up to provide light. [[Matt]] opens the doors and we all walk back through the main doors, then we all head through the door at the end. Above the door is a beaten bronze rising/setting sun and we enter a chapel.

There is a balcony 50ft above and on the balcony there are two dark shapes on tall chairs. The alter is carved with angelic figures with dark vines and there is a dark figure cloaked on the alter with a mace at its feet. [[Alder]] moves all of the dust to the side while [[Janet]] picks up the mace at the alter (t’s a mace of terror) and gives it to [[Matt]]. [[Galina]] flies up and has a look at the balcony. There are two thrones, which face away from the double doors. When she appears the figures on the thrones come to life and are zombies, which attempt to strike [[Galina]]. 

[[Matt]] has a look at the body on the alter, he can see that it's a corpse of a man dressed in plate and clerical robes. His hand is reaching for the silver statuette on the alter (which is the Icon of Ravenloft). [[Matt]] can see that it's a consecration artefact, which is used specifically in clerical rituals.

We notice that the Strahd in the stained glass looked like he is actually a person and [[Matt]] notices that this was a chapel devoted to worshipping the [[Morning Lord]]. 

[[Matt]] casts speaks to dead on the corpse at the alter:
1. Who are you?
	1. [[Gustav Herrenghast]]
2. What are you doing here?
	1. Attempted to obtain the Icon of Ravenloft
3. Why did you try to steal it?
	1. To gain access to its powers
4. How do you get to the dungeon?
	1. I dont know
5. What are [[Strahd von Zarovich]]'s weaknesses?
	1. All of the weaknesses of a creature of the night

We leave the Chapel and head down some stairs until we hit a wall, we notice that there is a chink in the wall. [[Janet]] hits it with a great axe, it does chip the wall, but only a little. [[Emereth]] punches the wall, but we decide to come back later since the work is slow.

**Quest triggered: [[Break the Wall]]**

We head back through the dining hall and take one of the corridors. At the end there is a door, to the immediate left of the bottom of the staircase there is a room. Inside the room there is yellow lichen and a bunch of dead guards in their beds (this is a guards chamber room). The skeletons of the guards rise and come for us. We shatter them into 10000000 pieces.

We enter another room full of bones and notice that all of the bones are human. We all head to the door at the other end of the room. We head into [[Rahadin]]’s office. He asks why we are here and [[Matt]] says that we are wanting to leave [[Barovia]]. [[Rahadin]] says that we are not allowed to leave, he then initiates a fight with us and we will him and the demon that he conjured.
