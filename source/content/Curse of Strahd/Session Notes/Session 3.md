Who was here this session: [[Emereth]], [[Dogorasu]], [[Alder]], [[Galina]], [[Janet]], and [[Matt]]
# TLDR
[[Danicka Martikov]] provides us with directions to get to [[Wizard of Wines Vineyard]] and we ask [[Szoldar Szoldarovich]] and [[Yevgeni Krushkin]] to lead us there. [[Davian Martikov]] lets us know about the magic gems which are missing, as a result we choose to head to [[Yesterhill]]. When we get to [[Yesterhill]], [[Janet]] finds a blood spear and we see [[Strahd von Zarovich]] rise the dead and makes a giant tree come to life. We flee back to [[Wizard of Wines Vineyard]] and we fight a number of blights and druids.
# Detailed Notes
[[Matt]] asks [[Danicka Martikov]] more about the quest ([[More Wine!]]), she confirms the location of the vineyard. [[Danicka Martikov]] tells us the way but the Hunters [[Galina]] was talking to ([[Szoldar Szoldarovich]] and [[Yevgeni Krushkin]]) could lead us there for a cost. 

As this happens, [[Bard in Blue Water Inn]] leaves the [[The Blue Water Inn]] with a rucksack and says goodbye to [[Danicka Martikov]].

Once [[Szoldar Szoldarovich]] and [[Yevgeni Krushkin]] wake up, [[Matt]] asks them about guiding us to [[Wizard of Wines Vineyard]]. They state that its 5GP per day total and they do not travel at night. 

The party leaves [[Vallaki]] with [[Szoldar Szoldarovich]] and [[Yevgeni Krushkin]] and start walking towards [[Wizard of Wines Vineyard]]. 

We come to a four way intersection with the following signs:
* [[Krezk]] and [[Silenca Pass]]
* [[Lake Barotok]]
* [[Vallaki]] and [[Ravenloft]]
* [[Barez]]

[[Szoldar Szoldarovich]] and [[Yevgeni Krushkin]] steer us through the forest rather than past [[Lake Barotok]], as its quicker. 

We come across another sign which has the following signs:
* North - [[Krezk]]
* East - [[Vallaki]]
* South-West - [[Wizard of Wines Vineyard]]

We continue along the path to [[Wizard of Wines Vineyard]]. Once we get there we see a man ([[Davian Martikov]]) in a dark cloak and cowl. [[Janet]] walks up lets [[Davian Martikov]] know that we are here for the wine for [[The Blue Water Inn]]. [[Davian Martikov]] laughs, his son ([[Irwin Martikov]]) is his son. [[Janet]] asks him about the wine and he states that the winery is full of needle blights, which poisoned the fermentation vats.

[[Davian Martikov]] states that they cannot grow more wine, as the three gems which give the winery magic have been stolen. 

The details about the gems:
* Five days ago some druids, who are obsessed with dark powers took a gem to [[Yesterhill]]
* Weeks ago a gem was taken by the witch [[Baba Lysaga]], who is in the ruins of [[Barez]]
* Many years ago, a gem was dug up and stolen while [[Irwin Martikov]] was on watch.

**Quest triggered: [[Find the Wine Making Gems]]**

We decide to head to [[Yesterhill]]. As were leaving we meet [[Adrian Martikov]] and [[Elvir Martikov]], who agree to accompany us to [[Yesterhill]]. 

When we reach [[Yesterhill]] we start to head right to the top of the hill. On the way up, Janet hears a voice which says 'Long have I waited for one who is worthy. My spear longs for blood'. Janet heads towards the voice which leads her to a pile of rocks. Within the rocks are a pile of bones and a blood spear. As this happens a bat flies overhead and lands the in middle of the rocks at the top of the hill and turns into a handsome man ([[Strahd von Zarovich]]). 

[[Strahd von Zarovich]] animates the piles of bones (which start chanting) and summons an effigy at the top of the hill, which is 30ft tall and shaped like a tree with a green light out of it. 

We all run SO quickly, after [[Szoldar Szoldarovich]] and [[Yevgeni Krushkin]] confirmed that the handsome man is [[Strahd von Zarovich]]. We all head back to [[Wizard of Wines Vineyard]]. 

When we reach [[Wizard of Wines Vineyard]] 30 needle blights surge towards us. [[Adrian Martikov]] suggests that we should barricade ourselves, but we choose to fight. [[Adrian Martikov]] and [[Elvir Martikov]] turn into ravens. We manage to defeat the needle blights. 

We then enter the vineyard house, where we find a cart with three barrels labelled 'Purple Grape Mash Number 3'. When we reach the fermentation room there are more creatures and a druid which we defeat. The druid was pouring a potion into the fermentation vats, [[Alder]] doesnt know what the potion is, just that it smells rancid. 

As we exlore the house further, [[Janet]] finds a rocking horse which is black with a painted flame mane, it also has a label 'Busefalis - is no fun is no blinsky.'. 

[[Matt]] enters another room and sees another druid rooting around in the cupboard with two large creatures made of dead leaves.
