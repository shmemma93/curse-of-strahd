Who was here this session: [[Emereth]], [[Dogorasu]], [[Alder]], [[Galina]], [[Janet]], and [[Matt]]
# TLDR
We all wreck some more druids and [[Matt]] ends up with a staff. We find more wine in the cellar which we end up hauling onto the cart and taking with us back to [[The Blue Water Inn]]. Before we can leave for [[The Blue Water Inn]], the massive tree appears and Matt destroys it by snapping the staff. We get the wine to [[Irwin Martikov]]. We head to the [[Vallaki]] town square and find out the Festival of the Blazing Sun is happening tomorrow. [[Emereth]] frees the people in the stocks and we follow them to [[St Andral's Cathedral]]. There we find out that the bones of St Andral have been stolen and we need to retrieve them. We end up tracking down that the bones are in [[Henrik Van der Voort]]'s store, so we head there. 
# Detailed Notes
The group finishes off the needle blights and the druid. Then [[Galina]] heads into a bedroom. In it is a tapestry of a church with a rocking cradle under it and a bed with a raven headboard. 

Inside the chest [[Galina]] manages to unlock the chest and inside is:
* 270 electron peices (stamped with [[Strahd von Zarovich]]'s face)
* 50 GP
* 350 SP
Inside a hidden compartment in the chest she also finds:
* a gold locket
* 5 gem stones worth 50 GP each
* Photo of a pretty lady with raven coloured hair

Meanwhile, [[Matt]] has a look at what the druid was looking at and he finds a key on the bottom of the chest. The key does not belong to the chest that [[Galina]] broke into. 

Together we head into another room, there is a man inside the room who is covered in blood, he says 'Nature bows to my very whim, as I have the vampires staff!' in druidic. He tries to flee downstairs but the group kills him and [[Matt]] steals his staff. 

The staff is made of gnarled wood, blackened from head to toe and is approx. 4ft in length. It becomes apparent that it comes from the tree which at [[Yesterhill]]. 

We all enter the cellar and there is a voice who is casting a spell and there is a druid and five blights. After defeating them we see that there are three barrels of Purple Grape Mash number 3. 

[[Janet]] asks [[Adrian Martikov]] how they are able to turn into ravens. He states that the are [[Wereravens]] and are [[Keepers of the Feather]]. 

As we are talking to [[Adrian Martikov]], we feel the earth shaking and see the giant tree from [[Yesterhill]] lumbering towards us. [[Matt]] snaps the staff in half and the giant tree withers and dies

The Martikovs give us horses to take the wine back to [[The Blue Water Inn]]. [[Yevgeni Krushkin]], [[Szoldar Szoldarovich]], [[Adrian Martikov]] and [[Elvir Martikov]] come with us. 

When the group reaches [[Vallaki]] we drop the wine at [[The Blue Water Inn]]. [[Irwin Martikov]] comes outside and he is surprised that we succeeded. He says that we have free boarding at [[The Blue Water Inn]] as long as we are in [[Vallaki]] along with 150 GP and three potions of healing. 

We head to the Town Square where a man is yelling and letting everyone know that [[Burgomaster Vargus Vallakovich]] wants everyone to attend the Festival of the Blazing Sun tomorrow. Upon speaking to the yeller we find out that there is a festival every week in [[Vallaki]]. We ask about the people in the stocks, they forgot to pretend to be happy. The yeller also lets us know that 'Trouble' will land you a trip to [[Burgomaster Vargus Vallakovich]]'s mansion and you will not come back. 

[[Emereth]] walks up to one of the people in the stocks and he said that he asked for help and now he's in the stocks for three days. The man states that he just wants to leave town but [[Burgomaster Vargus Vallakovich]] will not let people leave. 

[[Emereth]] tries to get the guards to leave the people in the stocks, so he bribes them 50 GP and the guard lets the people go. 

The group then heads to [[St Andral's Cathedral]] where we can hear a crowd of people in the church. [[Galina]] enters the church where there are a number of Vallakians and children. They all look very concerned and [[Father Lucian Petrovich]] is trying to calm the people. 

[[Emereth]] asks whats happening and [[Father Lucian Petrovich]] confirmed that the people in [[St Andral's Cathedral]] are seeking refuge. We follow him to the back of the church. He lets us know that the church is protected by the holy bones of St Andral under the altar, but the bones have been stolen. Until the bones are returned, everyone in the church is at the mercy of [[Strahd von Zarovich]] and his monsters. 

**Quest triggered: [[Get the Bones of St Andral]]**

The Alter Boy ([[Yeska]]) is suspected of stealing the bones as he is the only person who knew about the bones. [[Galina]] heads towards the vestibule to talk to [[Yeska]], she needs to offer him a gem for information. [[Yeska]] points towards the window to the grave digger [[Milivoj]]. 

[[Father Lucian Petrovich]] says that [[Milivoj]] is unhappy and is antagonistic towards [[Burgomaster Vargus Vallakovich]]. 

[[Dogorasu]] threatens [[Milivoj]] to get information and says that he was hoping to sell the bones for money to the undertaker, [[Henrik Van der Voort]]. We pau [[Milivoj]] 15 GP to take us to [[Henrik Van der Voort]]. 

We arrive at [[Henrik Van der Voorts Shop]] and knock on the door, but he states that he's closed, but [[Galina]] breaks in. [[Henrik Van der Voort]] says that the bones are upstairs in a wooden storage area. He is waiting for [[Vasili von Holtz]] wanted the bones. 

[[Henrik Van der Voort]] points us to a door which has the bedroom and wardrobe in it, but we are prohibited from entering the upper level as it is infested with monsters. [[Emereth]] offers to help remove the monsters but [[Henrik Van der Voort]] does not want us to risk our lives. We head up the stairs, [[Matt]] finds his money and takes it while [[Emereth]] heads into the prohibited zone, he opens a chest and five vampire spawn appear.
