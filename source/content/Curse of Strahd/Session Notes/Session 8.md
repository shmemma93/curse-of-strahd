Who was here this session: [[Emereth]], [[Dogorasu]], [[Alder]], [[Galina]], [[Janet]], and [[Matt]]
# TLDR
We head to [[Barez]] and get absolutely fucked up by [[Baba Lysaga's Creeping Hut]]. Once we recover we head to [[Van Richten's Tower]] where we have a look around, and end up meeting [[Ezmerelda]]. She came from 'the castle' (we assume [[Ravenloft]]) where there are people still in the dungeon. She also lets us know that the Vistani aren't all bad and that she works for [[Rudolph van Richten]]

# Detailed Notes
[[Dogorasu]] climbs to the top of the [[Old Bonegrinder Mill]] and fails to set the thing on fire. Afterwards we travel on [[Old Svalich Road]] and meet a band of Vistani walking in the opposite direction. They offer to guide us back to [[Vallaki]] but they want 100GP, so we decide to go without their help. Once we reach [[The Blue Water Inn]] we have a drink and recover before heading to [[Barez]] in the morning. 

When arrive at [[Barez]] we look at the scarecrows (they are filled with black feathers) and the houses (they are just ruins). In the middle of the stones in the middle of the town we meet [[Muriel]], who tells us that danger lies beyond the river. She says that she has been watching [[Baba Lysaga]] for a couple of days. 

We find some goats and [[Alder]] talks to them. They let us know that [[Baba Lysaga]] takes one goat every moon cycle and they confirm that its only them and the 'old lady'. 

We head to the hut in the middle ([[Baba Lysaga's Creeping Hut]]), where there is the skull of a giant. [[Galina]] flies around and notes that inside there is an old lady leaning over a cradle and speaking to a baby. [[Galina]] ends up introducing herself to [[Baba Lysaga]] and asks about the gemstone. [[Baba Lysaga]] invites Galina in after saying 'What I take is now mine' and asks [[Galina]] to lie down and says 'You are my child now'. When [[Galina]] offers up [[Matt]] as a child instead, [[Matt]] walks in and one of the roots of the stump bashes him to the side. 

The whole party nearly dies after losing to [[Baba Lysaga's Creeping Hut]]. In the distance there are hooves in the silence and a tall, pallid, handsome man on horseback appears and looks down at us. He tells [[Baba Lysaga]] 'Baba, you should not have played with my toys, leave them to me', he then drops a letter on [[Galina]] which says that we would be his humbled guests at [[Ravenloft]]. As we come to we can hear [[Baba Lysaga]] crying over the crib and calls the baby Strahd. 

After taking shelter for a rest in [[Barez]], as we walk towards [[Van Richten's Tower]] we can hear the sounds of battle, but we can't see more than 60ft due to the fog. There is a battle going on with the mist taking the form of soldiers. We see a ghost mansion and a dragon wing cuts through the fog.

We keep walking down a forested path and come to a cold mountain lake and there is a flat marshy island where we can see [[Van Richten's Tower]]. Out the front of the tower there is a wagon which is newly painted and has gold trim. We can see that its locked and has a sign which reads 'KEEP OUT', but [[Matt]] cannot hear anything untoward coming from the wagon. 

Instead we decide to take a look at the tower. [[Janet]] walks up to the front door and gets hit by lightning. [[Matt]] takes a look at the sigil on the door but does not know what it is. [[Dogorasu]] then attempts to knock on the door but is also hit by lightning. [[Galina]] then flies around and tried to have a look inside.  On the bottom floor she sees a giant square contraption and four statues in a square formation around the contraption. When viewing the second floor there is a hole in the middle of the floor. When viewing the third floor, there is a hole in the wall, the floor is completely rotted, there are chains in the middle which go down through the hole in the floor, it looks like some kind of mechanism. The fourth floor looks like a study with a bed, in the middle there is an elevator car. The tower is empty.

[[Emereth]] manages to scale the scaffolding on the outside of the tower all the way up to the third floor. Once inside she jumps down to the bottom floor, then opens the front door from the inside. Soon each of the hour statues beings to move and pull on the chains, so we all hop on the elevator and ride to the fourth level. 

The fourth level shows signs of recent occupation. Janet has a look in the chest at the foot of the bed, there is a severed head, it looks waxy and smells strongly of lavender ([[Ezmerelda]] later confirms that this is a Vistani looter who [[Rudolph van Richten]] uses Speak to the Dead on). Matt has a look at the desk and there is nothing there. There is no paper or ink and all drawers have been emptied. Emereth looks at the suit of armour, but its just a suit of armour.

After about 30 mins of milling around, we hear a galloping horse approaching. Matt tries to take a look at who it is. [[Ezmerelda]] takes one look at the open front door and walks to the wagon, gets on her stomach and gets underneath it, then re-emerges after about 10 mins and heads to the tower. She takes the elevator and arrives with a crossbow in one hand and a sword on another. 

[[Ezmerelda]] then asks us why we're where in the tower, so we tell her about [[Rictavio]], she has an injured leg and abdomen and tells us that she was in the castle and [[Rictavio]] went to save her. 

[[Ezmerelda]] says that not all Vistani follow [[Strahd von Zarovich]] and there are things that the Vistani have done for [[Strahd von Zarovich]] which she is not happy with. 

She says that she kidnapped [[Van Richten's Son]] and went to hand him to [[Strahd von Zarovich]], but [[Rudolph van Richten]] showed kindness and she now works for him. 

[[Ezmerelda]] confirms to us that [[Strahd von Zarovich]] has a dungeon in [[Ravenloft]] and that there are people down there and that the scaffolding is the way that [[Van Richten's Tower]] is typically entered.
