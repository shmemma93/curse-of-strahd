Who was here this session: [[Emereth]], [[Dogorasu]], [[Alder]], [[Galina]], [[Janet]], and [[Matt]]
# TLDR
We leave [[Blinsky's Toy Store]] and meet [[Ernst]], who tells us that his employer would like to be friends with us. We then head to the Town Square of [[Vallaki]] for the Festival of the Blazing Sun, where it rains and [[Wachter Brother 1]] and [[Wachter Brother 2]] have let one of [[Rictavio]]'s sabre tooth tigers out and is being chased. We save the tiger and meet [[Izek Strazni]] before heading back to [[The Blue Water Inn]], where we chat with [[Wachter Brother 1]] and [[Wachter Brother 2]] before heading to [[Lady Wachter's House]] for dinner. We agree to help coup [[Burgomaster Vargus Vallakovich]]. When we again head back to [[The Blue Water Inn]] we find a letter from [[Rictavio]] directing us to a tower near [[Lake Barotok]] and then we head to [[Ireena Kolyana]], we show her the doll of herself and [[Izek Strazni]]. We then head to [[Burgomaster of Vallaki's Mansion]] and knock [[Izek Strazni]] unconscious before killing [[Burgomaster Vargus Vallakovich]]'s dogs.

# Detailed Notes
We leave [[Blinsky's Toy Store]] and we meet [[Ernst]], who tries to run, [[Janet]] and [[Emereth]] chase him down. He says that he serves someone he doesn't wish to implicate, but he states that he does not work for [[Strahd von Zarovich]], as [[Strahd von Zarovich]] is too highly regarded. He says that we are worthy of the friendship of his employer and he will meet us at [[The Blue Water Inn]] after the Festival. 

We join the people walking to the town square. [[Burgomaster Vargus Vallakovich]] attempts to light a large wicker ball but the rain starts and he is unable to light it. A man in the crows laughs and is tied and wheeled around the town in a cart. The rain gets heavier and the townsfolk start to head home. As this happens there are two large screams and [[Wachter Brother 1]] and [[Wachter Brother 2]] approach from a westerly direction. They are bloodied and are followed by a sabre tooth tiger who is chasing them through the street, but it stops and retreats when it nears people. 

[[Matt]] and [[Alder]] run after the tiger, who lets them know that its master is 'fancy man in blue, carrying a wooden stick' (this is [[Rictavio]]). There are footsteps approaching and [[Alder]] tells the tiger to run. When the guards and [[Izek Strazni]] approach searching for the tiger, we point them in the wrong direction. We notice that [[Izek Strazni]] matches another doll from [[Blinsky's Toy Store]]. 

We head back to the Town Square to find [[Wachter Brother 1]] and [[Wachter Brother 2]] but we are pointed to [[The Blue Water Inn]]. When we arrive we find [[Rictavio]], [[Wachter Brother 1]] and [[Wachter Brother 2]] are all there. 

We have a chat to [[Wachter Brother 1]] and [[Wachter Brother 2]] who confirm that [[Lady Fiona Wachter]] has beef with [[Burgomaster Vargus Vallakovich]]. [[Matt]] asks about the Burgomaster, he is told that there is a Burgomaster (who has a statue in the town square, which is labelled as 'Ismark Koylanovich'), but of the two most recent, the last was [[Burgomaster Vargus Vallakovich]]'s father. We wonder if [[Ismark Koylanovich]] is named after the statue...

We end up heading to [[Lady Wachter's House]] for dinner where we see that [[Wachter Brother 1]] and [[Wachter Brother 2]] do not listen to their mother at all. [[Lady Fiona Wachter]] confirms that she works with [[Strahd von Zarovich]], as a result, she wants to perform a coup on [[Burgomaster Vargus Vallakovich]]. She believes that [[Burgomaster Vargus Vallakovich]] dabbles in diabolic magic and [[Strahd von Zarovich]] wants the people of [[Vallaki]] under control. [[Lady Fiona Wachter]] also states that 'her people' used to be the leaders of the town, but for reasons unknown her family fell and the Vallakovich family came into power. 

**Quest triggered: [[Coup the Baron]]**

We agree that we will hunt down [[Izek Strazni]] tomorrow, so we head to [[The Blue Water Inn]] to meet [[Rictavio]]. When we arrive he has left a letter on his bed. [[Matt]] reads the letter which indicates that he is in a tower near [[Lake Barotok]]. He signs the letter 'Rudolph van Richten'. 

**Quest triggered: [[Meet Rictavio at Lake Baratok]]**

We then decide to talk to [[Ireena Kolyana]] and ask about the toy of herself and [[Izek Strazni]]. [[Ireena Kolyana]] lets us know that she has no idea who [[Izek Strazni]] is. We tell her about the plan to coup [[Burgomaster Vargus Vallakovich]], she wants to come along. We all head to [[Burgomaster of Vallaki's Mansion]], once there we unpick the front door, we head upstairs, find and knock [[Izek Strazni]] unconscious. [[Burgomaster Vargus Vallakovich]]'s dogs hear us, but [[Janet]] kills them.
