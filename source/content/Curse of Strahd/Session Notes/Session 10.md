# TLDR


# Detailed Notes
After having a break in [[Rahadin]]'s office, we head back to the Bone Room to investigate behind the door with the Dragon Skull above it. [[Galina]] knocks on the door, there are footsteps and the door opens. [[Galina]] introduces herself to [[Cyrus]] and asks if we can enter the room, we note that he is wearing a chain with an eye and a silver key on it. [[Cyrus]] lets us know that there is nothing of interest here but he can show us to our rooms. 

We ask him about his work and he confirms that he works for [[Strahd von Zarovich]] as a servant and the caretaker of [[Ravenloft]]. We then ask [[Cyrus]] about his skin and he says that there is nothing wrong with it, but but his mother fucked a lizard and a cat. We then ask about the key on the chain and he lets us know that the key is private and his master would be unhappy if he tells us what its for. When asked about the eye on the chain he says 'What eye'?

We follow [[Cyrus]] us to our quarters, but on the way we stand on a piece of stone and it sinks into the ground as a portcullis drops over the top of us and gas is pumped into the room around us causing [[Alder]], [[Emereth]], and [[Dogorasu]] to fall asleep while [[Cyrus]] is coughing. 

We then kill [[Cyrus]] and open the door which is at the top of the portcullis. [[Janet]] lifts [[Galina]] and [[Matt]] onto the top of the portcullis and they find that there is a trap door on the roof, which [[Galina]] opens. When she looks around she sees portrait of a handsome and well dressed man ([[Strahd Portrait.png]]) and there is a an iron bound wooden door. [[Galina]] tries to open the door and when she does she finds a fancy lounge room, she notices that the wall is curved (like we are in a tower) and there is a book case and a door. In the room she sees [[Escher Belasco]] sitting on a chair and drinking wine, so she introduces herself and sits next to him. [[Escher Belasco]] says that he is grateful for the company but is confused about how we got here. [[Escher Belasco]] says that he has been in service of [[Strahd von Zarovich]] for many, many years. He says that ‘work’ is not the term he would use and he is in service. He says that working for [[Strahd von Zarovich]] has its perks, but [[Strahd von Zarovich]] has been a little bitch lately and [[Escher Belasco]] doesn’t know why. [[Galina]] asks where the dungeon is but he says that he will not show us where the prisoners are, so [[Galina]] tries to convince him, and he says that the dungeons are on the deepest level, all you have to do is go down. He warns that leaving with a prisoner will incur [[Strahd von Zarovich]]'s wrath. He says that if we survive he would like to see [[Galina]] again, so she lets him know that we are typically in [[Vallaki]], so he says that he will get a drink with her.  

While [[Galina]] is talking to [[Escher Belasco]], [[Janet]] wakes everyone else up and we all manage to get out of the portcullis. We then head down a spiral staircase, when we reach the bottom we find a pool of water which looks like black glass and its submerging doors. There is a weak cry for help from the door on the left. [[Galina]] throws a stone into the water and it just sinks to the bottom. [[Galina]] then flies to the door and listens, she can hear a mans voice wavering whole asking for help, when she tries to push on the door, it doesn't move. [[Janet]] then steps into the water to help but is sucked under and ends up in a cell filled with 5ft of water.

The party (minus [[Janet]]) decides to look around. We find a room with two thrones and a red velvet curtain. [[Galina]] takes a look behind the curtain and finds a table with 7 cup shaped indentations, in each there is a round stone, none are the same colour. There is also an hour glass, where all of the sand is stuck at the top of the hourglass. There is an inscription on the hourglass which reads:

*‘Cast a stone into the fire:* 
*Violet leads to the mountain spire* 
*Orange to the castle’s peak*
*Red if lore is what you seek* 
*Green to where the coffins hide* 
*Indigo to the master’s bride*
*Blue to ancient magic’s womb* 
*Yellow to the master’s tomb’*

Meanwhile, [[Janet]] talks to [[Emeile]] and he says that he was chased by direwolfs and managed to stumble into [[Strahd von Zarovich]]'s clutches. He also says that he came too close a dangerous man. After this conversation, [[Janet]] tries to open the door and fails.

In an attempt to free [[Janet]], [[Alder]] creates cubes of ice which allow [[Dogorasu]] to walk across the water, once be reaches the door he managed to rip the outer door off of its hinges, [[Galina]] then tries to unpick the lock of the innter door, but she does not succeed and [[Dogorasu]] can't rip the bars off. We then try the key we took from Cyrus, but it doesn't work, eventually [[Galina]] manages to unpick the locks on both [[Janet]] and [[Emeile]]'s doors. 

To the left there is a cell with an elaborate pulley system inside with an unconscious man ([[Rudolph van Richten]]) strung up by the pulley system being continually dunked into the water. [[Galina]] cuts the rope and he falls into the water before [[Galina]] drags him back to the group at the base of the stairs. 

[[Galina]] then heads back to the cells and sees a slumped figure on a smashed crate. She picks the lock and recognises her half-sister, who she also brings back to the group. [[Alder]] then guides the water out of hers and [[Rudolph van Richten]]'s lungs to revive them. 

Once he is revived, [[Rudolph van Richten]] tells us that he was inhabiting [[Rictavio]]'s being. 

We head up the spiral staircase another level, we end up seeing a giant weighted stone, which is clearly part of the elevator system. We keep walking and end up in the wine cellar where there are a number of barrels marked as Wizard of Wines. [[Janet]] tries to steal the champagne, but its just full of mould, so she tries for the Red Dragon crush, which is filled with a black sludge, which attacks the party. 

Once we kill the sludge, we open a door where we see a tapestry of [[Ravenloft]]. We see a cauldron of green stuff over hot coals. [[Galina]] puts out the coals and [[Janet]] sniffs the green sludge and three zombies climb out but Janet just pushes them back in the cauldron.
