Who was here this session: [[Emereth]], [[Dogorasu]], [[Alder]], [[Galina]], [[Janet]], and [[Matt]]
# TLDR
We end up finding [[Victor Vallakovich]], who is also trying to leave [[Barovia]] using necromancy and a teleportation spell, but he wants to kill us when we say that we killed [[Baroness Lydia Petrovna]] and [[Burgomaster Vargus Vallakovich]]. After killing  [[Victor Vallakovich]] we meet and free [[Udo Lukovich]] from the torture chamber before putting [[Izek Strazni]] into the torture chamber. We torture [[Izek Strazni]] but he wont say anything about the dolls until [[Galina]] threatens to destroy some. He recognises [[Ireena Kolyana]] and tells us that she features in his dreams, but he refuses to say where the dreams come from, so [[Matt]] kills him. We then head to see [[Lady Fiona Wachter]], who is very thankful that we killed the Burgomaster and his family.  Afterwards we head to the [[Old Bonegrinder Mill]] and when we arrive, we kill the [[Main Hag]] and [[Hags Daughters]].

# Detailed Notes
We all enter the attic to find a room full of stuff. [[Galina]] walks up to a door at the end of the room and she can hear a young man talking, but cannot make out what is being said. She opens the door and find the following items:

* Skeletal cats skulking
* Three small children which are painted dolls
* Bones everywhere
* Theres no one here making noises

[[Alder]] recognises that the cats are from the school of necromancy and [[Matt]] casts see invisibility and sees [[Victor Vallakovich]] standing in the back of the room holding a book. [[Matt]] talks to [[Victor Vallakovich]] and manages to convince him to drop the invisibility

[[Victor Vallakovich]] says that he is the son of [[Burgomaster Vargus Vallakovich]] and the attic is his room. He also tells us that he is an aspiring mage trying to learn magic. He tells us that he is trying to use necromancy to leave [[Barovia]] because it is a living hell. He believes that he is close to perfecting the magic. [[Emereth]] tells him that his parents are dead and [[Victor Vallakovich]] starts sobbing which turns into maniacal laughter, but says that he cant let us live now that we have killed his parents. 

After killing [[Victor Vallakovich]], [[Emereth]] takes his spell book and gives it to [[Alder]]. We then loot [[Victor Vallakovich]]'s room and the adjoining junk room. [[Emereth]] find a leather bound journal with the [[Tome of Strahd von Zarovich]] earmarked. 

[[Matt]] decides to talk to [[Victor Vallakovich]] who answers the following:

1. Where did Strahds books come from? 
	1. I don't know
2. Where is your research about escaping Barovia?
	1. In my room
3. What were you missing from how to escape?
	1. I have not yet perfected my spell
4. Which desk if your research on?
	1. The one you are standing next to
5. What are the dolls for?
	1. They are my disobedient students

[[Matt]] takes a look at the research and can see that [[Victor Vallakovich]] was trying to drum up a spell of teleportation. 

We head back downstairs to [[Izek Strazni]] and we find a badly injured man in a loin cloth ([[Udo Lukovich]]). [[Matt]] heals him and he makes it clear that he hates [[Burgomaster Vargus Vallakovich]] and lets us know that he is heading to [[St Andral's Cathedral]] to talk to [[Father Lucian Petrovich]]. 

We drag [[Izek Strazni]] into the torture chamber and put him the shackles and give him a single good berry. We then bring in [[Ireena Kolyana]] and [[Izek Strazni]] recognises her immediately. When asked why he is obsessed with her, [[Izek Strazni]] tells us to do our worst. We torture him, but he says nothing until [[Galina]] brings in some of his dolls and threatens to destroy them. [[Izek Strazni]] then tells us ‘Every night I go to bed, I close my eyes and see her. My fair maiden, one day she will be mine’. [[Ireena Kolyana]] puller her rapier out and points it at him while [[Matt]] asks how [[Izek Strazni]] got his arm. [[Izek Strazni]] says that he doesn't know, he went to bed drunk and woke up with the arm, he assumed his master [[Burgomaster Vargus Vallakovich]] gave it to him. [[Izek Strazni]] refuses to confirm where his dreams are coming from, so [[Matt]] kills him. 

We all head to [[The Blue Water Inn]] for a rest then head to see [[Lady Fiona Wachter]] and we let her know that [[Burgomaster Vargus Vallakovich]], [[Baroness Lydia Petrovna]], and [[Izek Strazni]] are all dead. [[Lady Fiona Wachter]] says that she will be in contact with [[Strahd von Zarovich]] and will give is a good reference. 

We leave [[Ireena Kolyana]] at [[The Blue Water Inn]] and head towards the [[Old Bonegrinder Mill]]. When we arrive we manage to kill [[Main Hag]] and [[Hags Daughters]].
