Who was here this session: [[Emereth]], [[Dogorasu]], [[Alder]], [[Galina]], [[Janet]], and [[Matt]]
# TLDR
We head to the [[Old Bonegrinder Mill]] where we meet [[Main Hag]] before fleeing. We come across the [[Megaliths]] and then a pack of wolves who seem to work for [[Strahd von Zarovich]]. When we reach [[Lake Zarovich]] we save [[Arabelle]] from drowning. We then head to the [[Vistani Camp]] to drop off [[Arabelle]] to her father, [[Vuvash]]. Then we head to [[The Blue Water Inn]] where we find out that they are nearly out of wine. 
# Detailed Notes
The party enters the [[Old Bonegrinder Mill]] and takes a look around the ground floor. [[Galina]] opens the cupboard, sees and steals vials labelled youth (golden yellow), laughter (red), and mothers milk (green). 

[[Dogorasu]] heads up to the second floor, [[Janet]], [[Emereth]], and [[Matt]] follow him and they meet [[Main Hag]], she then calls her daughters ([[Hags Daughters]]). [[Emereth]] attacks one of the hags and we all get absolutely wrecked so we all run away. 

As we're leaving we see the [[Megaliths]]. [[Janet]] manages to pick up a 5ft tall rock, a pastry falls off of the rock and she eats it and immediately falls unconscious. Matt takes a look at the rocks, he notices a pile of teeth at the foot of one of the rocks and remembers that [[Archfey, Kithilan of the Crooked-Teeth]] takes offerings of teeth.

The party keeps walking and comes across a pack of wolves. [[Alder]] speaks to the wolves and they seem to work for [[Strahd von Zarovich]] as "their master lives in a big stone cave". [[Alder]] tries to convince them to let us pass, but they are not convinced. We manage to leave.

We come across a lake ([[Lake Zarovich]]]), we see a man on a boat drop a sack into the lake. We grab two extra boats and row out after the man. [[Emereth]] was unable to pull up the sack but [[Janet]] manages to haul it into their boat.  After opening the sack we meet a child ([[Arabelle]]). She wants to go back to a camp near [[Vallaki]] ([[Vistani Camp]]). 

**Quest triggered: [[Return Arabelle to Her Father]]**

We head back to [[Ismark Koylanovich]] and [[Ireena Kolyana]] and head to [[Vallaki]] on [[Old Svalich Road]].

Once we reach [[Vallaki]], [[Ireena Kolyana]] and [[Ismark Koylanovich]] leave the group and we all head to the [[Vistani Camp]] and meet up with [[Vuvash]]. We see that he is whipping [[Alexi]]. 

Because we returned [[Arabelle]] safely, we are able to choose two of the following items:

* Wooden chest
* Iron Chest
* Onyx chest
* Wooden throne
* RugÂ 
* Small wooden box

We ended up selecting the Onyx chest which contained 600 gold and the small wooden box, which had 12 stoppered gourds with nettle wine in them. 

The group now headed to the [[The Blue Water Inn]]. Here [[Galina]] plays Five Finger Fillet with two drunk guys ([[Szoldar Szoldarovich]] and [[Yevgeni Krushkin]]) in the bar and wins, [[Matt]] finds [[Ismark Koylanovich]] and has a chat, [[Emereth]] tries to talk up [[Bard in Blue Water Inn]], but shes not succeeding. [[Janet]] speaks to [[Danicka Martikov]] who confesses that they are nearly out of wine. [[Janet]] agrees but loudly tells the Inn that they are nearly out of wine

**Quest Triggered: [[More Wine!]]**
