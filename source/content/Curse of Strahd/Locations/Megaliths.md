# Description
The Megaliths are massive stones which were erected out of the ground

The large stones in the middle depict 4 cities, one covered in snow, one flowers, one had a big sun big sun, the last is covered in leaves and the last (leaves) is being pecked at by ravens.Â 

The stones have to do with legends, one is about the morning lord. There is an old myth about the [[Morning Lord]] and [[Mother Night]] who used to do stuff with the cities of Summer, Autumn, Winter and Spring. This looks like it is a shrine to those cities. There is also a small pile of children's teeth near the shrine, they seem to have been here for a shot while. [[Archfey, Kithilan of the Crooked-Teeth]] often took teeth as offerings.
