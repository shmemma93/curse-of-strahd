# Description
On one side is the river and other side is a hilltop. Abandoned mansion appears, nestled into the hillside. The path leads on to Berez. At a fogged up marsh, trail hugs river. Tall reeds, pools of stagnant water, peasant houses with mold, and folded in roofs. On far side of river there is a light amidst dark standing stones. Twig like scarecrows scattered all over the place.
