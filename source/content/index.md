# Welcome to the Player Notes for Declan's Curse of Strahd Campaign!

In the menu on the left you will see a wiki type structure containing all of the details from the previous sessions. Unfortunately, mobile compatibility is not great, but you can use the search bar to navigate to other pages, I'll see what I can do to make it better.

On each page you will notice a couple of things:
* There are links out to other pages. 
* You will see 'Backlinks', these are all of the pages which reference the page you are currently on. 
* There is a 'Graph View' which indicates how many other pages reference the page that you are on. A graph with more links means the contents on the page is probably more important to the story. 

Please let me know if you see an issue/want to see something here and I will see what I can do about it. 

This currently includes all notes from:
* [[Session 1]]
* [[Session 2]]
* [[Session 3]]
* [[Session 4]]
* [[Session 5]]
* [[Session 6]]
